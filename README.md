# firstApp_forUnitAndIntegrationTesting
This project is created in order to implement Unit and partial Integration tests

## Framework and Goals
In this project, I used the last version of JUnit which is **JUnit5** to do unit and partial integration tests on application.</br>
The goal of this project is to learn a popular **TDD (Test-Driven Development)** approach of software development and be familiar with one of the **CI (Continuous Integration)**
tool, with **Jenkins**.</br>

## Resource
A book I used to read for learning JUnit5:
* ***JUnit in Action (3<sup>rd</sup> edition)***
